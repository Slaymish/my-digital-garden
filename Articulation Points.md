# Articulation Points in Java

An articulation point (or cut vertex) in a graph is a vertex that, if removed along with its associated edges, would cause an increase in the number of connected components. In other words, it is a point that connects different parts of the graph.

Finding articulation points is important in network analysis, as these points represent critical nodes whose failure can lead to network fragmentation. The Tarjan's algorithm can be used to find such articulation points efficiently.

# Example Code

Here's an implementation of the [[Tarjan's algorithm]] to find and print articulation points in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class ArticulationPoints {
    private int time = 0;
    private int[] low; // low-link value
    private int[] ids; // vertex id
    private boolean[] visited;
    private List<Integer> articulationPoints;

    public List<Integer> findArticulationPoints(List<List<Integer>> graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        low = new int[n];
        ids = new int[n];
        visited = new boolean[n];
        articulationPoints = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			pass;
		}
}
```
