# Terms

## Clock Period/Cycle

- Time between two adjacent pulses of the oscillator (eg period of wave)

$$1\ Clock \ Period = \frac{1}{freq \ of \ oscillator}$$

## Machine Cycle

<p align="center">
 12 oscillator periods (on a 8051)
</p>

## Instruction Cycle

- Usually 12?
- Time period of instruction being fetched and executed

<p align="center">
1-4 machine cycles (depending on instructions)
</p>


***

# Example

So if 1 machine cycle = $1 \mu s$, then 1 instruction would take $1 \mu s$
