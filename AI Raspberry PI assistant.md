# Smart Assistant with Voice Recognition and Long-Term Memory

## Overview

The goal of this software design is to create a smart assistant similar to Google Home or Alexa, utilising a Language Model (LLM) for conversational capabilities. The assistant should be able to perform various tasks, such as answering questions, controlling smart devices, and creating custom functions as needed. It should also feature voice identification to differentiate between different individuals in a household and leverage a long-term memory system to provide personalised information.

### Conversation and Task Execution:

- The smart assistant will be powered by an advanced Language Model (LLM) capable of natural language processing.
- The LLM will interact with users through voice commands and respond with spoken language.
- A command parser module should be implemented to extract the intent and entities from user queries.
- Based on the user's request, the LLM can call appropriate functions to execute tasks.
- Functions should be modular and categorised for ease of maintenance and extensibility.
- The system can dynamically assign an appropriate agent (e.g., chain-of-thought agent for complex inquiries) based on the nature of the question or task.

### Smart Device Integration:

- The smart assistant should support integration with various smart devices, such as lights, alarms, thermostats, etc.
- Functions will be created to control these devices, allowing users to issue voice commands for specific actions.
- Integration can be achieved through standardised protocols, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or proprietary APIs.

### Custom Function Creation:

- To address scenarios where a predefined function may not be available, the smart assistant should be capable of creating custom functions on-the-fly.
- The assistant can use natural language understanding techniques to interpret user requests and generate code snippets for new functions.
- A secure sandbox environment should be set up to evaluate and execute user-generated functions, ensuring safety and preventing malicious code execution.

### Voice Identification:

- The smart assistant should implement voice recognition technology to distinguish between different individuals speaking.
- Voiceprints unique to each person can be captured during the initial setup and stored securely for identification purposes.
- The system can utilise voice biometrics algorithms to match spoken commands with the corresponding user.

### Long-Term Memory:

- The smart assistant should incorporate a long-term memory system to store and retrieve past useful information.
- A vector database can be used to store information associated with different users.
- The memory system should prioritise storing information based on relevance and user preferences.
- Access to past information can be granted based on the identity of the user making the request.

### Trigger Word:

- The smart assistant should support a customisable trigger word that activates its listening mode.
- Each user can choose their preferred trigger word, enhancing personalisation.
- Trigger word detection can be achieved through real-time audio analysis using techniques like wake word detection.

### Privacy and Security:

- Privacy measures should be implemented to safeguard user data, including voice recordings and personal information.
- Encryption techniques can be employed to protect sensitive data during storage and transmission.
- Regular security audits and updates should be conducted to address potential vulnerabilities.

### Continuous Learning:

- The smart assistant can incorporate machine learning techniques to improve its performance and understanding over time.
- User feedback and interactions can be logged and utilised to enhance the assistant's responses and suggest personalised recommendations.
