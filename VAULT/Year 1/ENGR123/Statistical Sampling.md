## Typical Parameters

-   Mean
-   Variance
-   Standard deviation
-   Median
-   Proportion
-   %ile or quantile

  

## Simple Random Sampling

-   each random var is drawn from the same distribution
-   each var is independent of the other vars
-   Designed so the samples are **representative**

  

## Stratified Random Sampling

Stratified random sampling involves dividing your population into different subgroups proportionately by categories such as hair color or eye color and then taking a single random sample from each subgroup. Stratified random sampling helps you ensure that you're proportionately representing the entire sample and important subgroups of the population. Stratified random sampling may have higher statistical accuracy than a simple random sample because you take specific subgroups into account.

  

  

## SRS with Replacement

-   Every element in the population is equally likely

## Stratified Sampling

-   Divide pop into subgroups (strata)Â 
-   Select a SRS from each subgroup
-   Good estimate of the population parameters

## Cluster Sampling

-   Motivated by administrative convenience
-   Divide pop into several clusters
-   each representative of the population
-   Select a SRS of clusters

## Histogram

### Features

-   Frequency histogram
-   height of bar = frequency
-   Relative frequency histogram
-   height of bar = relative frequency
-   Probability histogram
-   Area of bar = relative frequency

### To Construct

-   Choose boundary points for the class intervals
-   Compute the frequency (or rel freq) for each class
-   Draw a rect for each class
-   If the classes have the same width, height of the rects may be set equal to the frequency
- To calculate amount of bins, use **[[Sturges Rule]]**
	- $bins=1+ceil(log_2n)$
