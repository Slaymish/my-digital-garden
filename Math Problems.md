## Here Are 5 Calculus and 5 Java-related Questions:

***

### Calculus:

1.  Evaluate the limit: $$\frac {\lim  }{x -> 2} \frac {x^2 - 4}{x - 2}$$
    
2.  Find the critical points of the function: $$f(x) = x^4 - 8x^3 + 18x^2 - 16x$$
    
3.  Calculate the integral: $$âˆ«(x^2 + 2x - 1) dx$$
    
4.  Use the chain rule to find the derivative of the function: $$g(x) = sin(3x^2 - 4x + 1)$$
    
5.  Find the area between the curves: 
.                                         $y = x^2$ and $y = x^3$, from $x = 0$ to $x = 1$

### Java:

1.  Write a Java program to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer using a recursive function.

```java
//CODE HERE
int fractorial(int num){
	


}
```

2.  Implement a Java class named "Circle" with attributes "radius" and methods "getArea()" and "getCircumference()". The class should also include a constructor to set the radius value.

```java
//CODE HERE
```

3.  Write a Java program that sorts an array of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

```java
//CODE HERE
```

4.  Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding in Java.

```java
//CODE HERE
```

5.  Write a Java program to read a text file and count the number of words in the file.

```java
//CODE HERE
```
