# Intro to C++

- *Most* C programs can run on a C++ compiler

## Difference with C

- Strong type checking
- New data types
- Classes
- OOP
- A standard library (STL)
	- String
	- List
	- stacks etc
- [[SWEN Generics\|Generic]] programming
- Exceptions for [[Error Handling]]

## Writing C++ Code

- Save as  .cpp
- [[NWEN Run your code#Run C++\|Running C++]]

## Headers

- Library header are **not** supposed to have an extension
- Though still works with .h/.hh/.hpp
- Most libraries come with a xxx.h and cxxx file

```
#include <stdio.h> == #include <cstdio>
```

***

# Datatypes

- Character
- Integer
- Float
- Double
- Boolean
- Wide
