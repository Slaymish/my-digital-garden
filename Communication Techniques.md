# Communication 101

- Detach the idea from the person
- So then when criticising the idea, you're not criticising the person

- Write things down
- Need documents to support that you've been engaged

- Team members should feel comfortable

## Respect

- Listen to people
- Trust
	- Meet face to face at least once
	- Stops them feeling like a 'service'
 - Honesty
	 - Be honest
	 - Situations can be managed lies cannot

## Unity

- Compromise in the face of stubbornness
	- Don't ignore disagreement
	- Try to understand the reasons behind it
- Work *with* group decisions
	- Don't say 'i don't you so' if you don't put in 100%
