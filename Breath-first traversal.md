# Breath-first Traversal

## Introduction to tree traversal:
- Definition of tree traversal: the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once
- Explanation of breath-first traversal: visits all nodes at the same level before moving on to the next level
- Example of breath-first traversal on a binary tree:
  - Starting at the root node
  - Visit left child, then right child
  - Move to second level and visit left and right children in order
  - Continue until all nodes have been visited
- Advantages of breath-first traversal:
  - Guarantees shortest path to a node
  - Useful for finding shortest path between two nodes
- Disadvantages of breath-first traversal:
  - Requires more memory than depth-first traversal 
- Real-world applications of breath-first traversal:
  - Web crawlers use it to index web pages 
  - Used in graph theory for finding shortest paths 
- Comparison with other tree traversal methods:
  - Depth-first traversal visits all nodes along a branch before backtracking 
- Conclusion and summary:
  - Breath-first traversal is useful for finding shortest paths and has real-world applications
