# Design Patterns

Describes a *reoccurring solution* to a problem that occurs in a context

## Three Levels

- Conceptual
- Specification
- Implementation

> [!INFO]
> Find what varies and encapsulate it.
> And favour composition over inheritance

## Patterns:

- [[Template Method Pattern\|Template Method Pattern]]
- [[Composite Pattern\|Composite Pattern]]
- [[Adapter Pattern\|Adapter Pattern]]
- [[Abstract Factory Pattern\|Abstract Factory Pattern]]
- [[Bridge Pattern\|Bridge Pattern]]
- [[Facade Pattern\|Facade Pattern]]
- [[Observer Pattern\|Observer Pattern]]
- [[Singleton Pattern\|Singleton Pattern]]
- [[Strategy Pattern\|Strategy Pattern]]

## Background

The **Gang of Four** came up with this way to describe a pattern
- Name
- Motivation
- Applicability
- Structure
- Participants
- Collaboration
- Consequences
- Related Patterns

### Designing With Design Patterns

- Enumerate all relevant patterns
- Compare each pair of pattern, and find which pattern would make the context for the other
- Find the **Senior-most** pattern (the pattern that doesn't get its context made by another pattern)
