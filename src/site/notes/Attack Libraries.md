- Argument against [[STRIDE\|STRIDE]] is that its too abstract
	- Only provides type of threats

## Checklist Security

- Professionals sceptical of this approach
- Can be used to avoid common problems
- Good for stuff like safety
	- EG airplane takeoff checklist
- Only avoid threats associated with the problems on checklist
	- Can provide a false sense of security

# [[MITRE Projects\|MITRE Projects]]

- general in scope
- community led, and government funded
- Draw back is that it can be overwhelming with so many threats

# [[OWASP Project\|OWASP Project]]

- Web app specific
- good for job interviews
