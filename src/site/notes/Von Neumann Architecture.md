# Von Neumann Architecture

- program instructions and data **share the same memory and pathways**

Von Neumann Architecture: This architecture uses the same physical memory address for instructions and data, requires two clock cycles to execute an instruction, and cannot perform instruction fetches and data transfers at the same time. It's used in laptops, personal computers, and workstations. On the other hand, the Harvard architecture uses separate memory addresses for instructions and data, requires only one cycle to complete an instruction, and can perform instruction fetches and data transfers at the same time. It's often used in signal processing and micro-controllersâ€‹[3](https://teachcomputerscience.com/von-neumann-harvard-architecture/)
