# Types of Memory

## Volatile Memory

- requires electricity to retain information
- Typical semiconductor memory

***

## Non-Volatile Memory

- Retains memory when no electrical power is supplied
- Eg magnetic or optical memory

***

## Random Access Memory

- Memory where the physical location of the [[Memory#Memory Word\|memory word]] has no effect on how long it takes to access
- Same for all words in system

***

## Sequential Access Memory (SAM)

- The [[Memory#Access Time ($t_{ACC}$)\|access time]] isn't constant
- Depends on address location
- Used when memory words must be accessed in the same order every time
	- Eg DVD, video memory, even DRAM

***

## Read Write Memory (RWM)

- Memory that can be written to or read from with equal ease

***

## Read only Memory (ROM)

- For application with many read cycles, typically only one write cycle
- Alls ROM is **non volatile**

***

## Static Memory Devices (SRAM)

- **Semiconductor memory** in which stored data will remain permanently as long as power is applied **without need for refreshing** (re-writing the data)

***

## Dynamic Memory Devices (DRAM)

- Semiconductor memory where the stored data **needs** to be constantly refreshed



# Typical Setup

## Main Memory

- DRAM
- Typically stores the computers working memory
- Stores instructions and data that the CPU is currently working on

## Auxiliary Memory (mass storage)

- Stores large amount of data **external** to main memory
- Slower than main memory and always non-volatile
- SSD/Flashdrive

## Cache Memory

- SRAM
- High speed block of memory
- Operates between main memory and the CPU to optimise speed of the computer
