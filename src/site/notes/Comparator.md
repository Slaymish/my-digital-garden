# Practically A-to-D

- **Compare** the incoming Voltage to certain, set reference levels
- **Set** the binary output state according to this comparison

## Comparator

- Based on an operational amplifier
- Takes an analogue signal at its inputs and compares it to a reference analogue signal
- Depending on input, output of comparator is either **HI** or **LO**
- Can be described as a single bit [[Digital to Analog Conversion\|analogue to digital convertor]]

- Many types of A/D are based on or use the [[Comparator\|Comparator]]

### Two Types

*Both known as [[Feedback ADCs\|Feedback ADCs]]*

1) The [[Staircase ADC\|Staircase ADC]]
2) The [[Successive Approximation (SAC) Convertor\|Successive Approximation (SAC) Convertor]]
