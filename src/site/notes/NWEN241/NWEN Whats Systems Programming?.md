**Systems program/software:**
- Support the operation/use of the computer system itself
- Could contain low-level code

**Low-level code:**
- Programs that directly accesses registers or memory locations
- Use intructions specific to a computer architecture
- Used for eg in
	- os
	- drivers
	- compilers,txt editors etc
	- vm's
	- server programs

### Why C/C++?
*Supports high-lvl abstractions and low-lvl acess to hardware*

**High-lvl abstractions:**
- User-defined types
- data structures
- functions

**Low-lvl access:**
- Possible access to registers
- dynamic memory allocation (read [[Memory Leaks\|Memory Leaks]])
- Inclusion of assembly code
