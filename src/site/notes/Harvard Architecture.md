# Harvard Architecture

The Harvard architecture is a [[Computer Architectures\|Computer Architectures]] that **separates storage and signal pathways for instructions and data**. 

In contrast with the [[Von Neumann Architecture\|Von Neumann Architecture]], where program instructions and data share the same memory and pathways. 

- Separates storage and signal pathways for instructions and data
- *no need for the two memories to share characteristics*. 

For instance, the word width, timing, implementation technology, and memory address structure can differ. Also, a Harvard architecture machine has distinct code and data address spaces.

In a computer using the Harvard architecture, the CPU can both **read an instruction** and **perform a data memory access at the same time**, even without a cache. This makes a Harvard architecture computer potentially faster.
