# Infrastructure as a Service

Infrastructure as a service is a cloud computing service model by means of which computing resources are supplied by a cloud services provider. 

**The IaaS vendor provides the storage, network, servers, and virtualisation.** This service enables users to free themselves from maintaining an on-premises data center. The [[IaaS\|IaaS]] provider is hosting these resources in either the public cloud, the private cloud, or the hybrid cloud.
