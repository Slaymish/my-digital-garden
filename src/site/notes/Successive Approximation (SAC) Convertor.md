# Successive Approximation (SAC) Convertor

The Successive Approximation Register (SAR) [[Analogue to Digital Convertor\|Analogue to Digital Convertor]] (ADC) is a popular method of converting an analog voltage to a digital value. 

## [[ADC0804 8-bit SAC\|ADC0804 8-bit SAC]]

- 8-bit successive-approximation ADC with tristate outputs. 
- Numbers in parentheses are in the IC's pin number

## Basic Operation

Comparing the input analog voltage with a reference voltage generated by an internal Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC). 

The comparison result is used to adjust the DAC output iteratively until the reference voltage matches the input voltage as closely as possible.

## Characteristics of the SAC Process

- Number of comparison steps is always equal to the number of output bits in the convertor

- The time to perform a conversion process will always be the same for a particular converter

- Relatively fast compared to other convertors (eg [[Staircase ADC\|Staircase ADC]]). Not as fast as [[Flash ADC\|Flash ADC]]

## Steps

1. An input analog voltage is applied to the SAR ADC.
2. The conversion process begins with setting the most significant bit (MSB) of the digital output code.
3. The internal DAC generates a reference voltage based on this initial code.
4. A comparator compares the input voltage with the reference voltage.
5. If the input voltage is greater than or equal to the reference, then the MSB remains set at 1; otherwise, it's reset to 0.
6. Next, the second most significant bit (2nd MSB) is set, and steps 3-5 are repeated for this new code.
7. This process continues for each bit in the digital output code until all bits have been considered.

Once all bits are processed, we obtain a digital output value that closely represents our input analog value.
