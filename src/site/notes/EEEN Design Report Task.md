## Purpose of the Report

As you going the leave JPL at the end of your summer holiday it is essential  
that the primary purpose of your report is to leave a clear record of your  
work so that people working on the project after you can continue with the  
work. It should thus contain a clear description of the design process (how  
did you come up with this circuit ?) and well-labelled circuit diagrams. All  
inputs and outputs on the circuits must then be clearly labelled and any  
further information that may be of use must be added to the circuits.


You should generate a report that should include the following:
- A description of the design process and method for each of the sub-systems.
- A short statement that you have tested it and that it works as desired. If it does not work correctly or you discover some glitches, these should be pointed out and discussed. You can also propose alternative solutions to solve any problems.
- You should submit the circuit diagrams for each of the sub-systems.
