# Intro to C++

- *Most* C programs can run on a C++ compiler

## Difference with C

- Strong type checking
- New data types
- Classes
- OOP
- A standard library (STL)
	- String
	- List
	- stacks etc
- [[SWEN Generics\|Generic]] programming
- Exceptions for [[SWEN221/Error Handling\|Error Handling]]

## Writing C++ Code

- Save as  .cpp
- [[NWEN241/NWEN Run your code#Run C++\|Running C++]]

## Headers

- Library header are **not** supposed to have an extension
- Though still works with .h/.hh/.hpp
