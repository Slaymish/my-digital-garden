# 2019 Test

## 1)

```
Its compatable with the DS89C450
```

## 2)

a)

```
The Von Numann Architecture makes use of shared data and program memory
```

b)

```
Havard Architecture makes use of separate data and program memories
```

c)

```
The 8051 uses the Havard Architecture
```

d)

```
CISC stands for 'Complex Instruction Set Computing'

Yes, as it has multiple instruction that do a series of actions. For example ACALL increments the program counter, and pushes to the stack pointer
```

## 3)

```
12 clock cycles per machine cycle 
```

## 4)

a)

$\frac {12}{40} = 0.3 \mu s$

b)

$\frac {12}{12} = 1 \mu s$

## 5)

a)

```
Arithmetic Logic unit
```

b)

```
The Accumulator
```

c)

```
The accumulator is an 8-bit register
```

d)

```
The program counter register (PC)
```

## 6)

a)

```
0d16 = 16 in decimal
0x10 in hex
```

b)

```
0xFF is larger (==255 in dec)
```

c)

```
bits = 256
hex = 255
0xFF is smaller
```

d)

```
0b==1010==1010
```

## 7)

a)

```
The NOP instruction does 'no operation'. It means the 8051 will be nothing for one machine cycle
```

b)

```
The INC instruciton 'increments' the value in the specified register by 1. It automatically resets to 0 if the value of the register is 0xFF (max num)
```

## 8)

```
c 

When MOV called, src is moved to dest while retaining src
```

## 9)

```
c (ACALL)
```

## 10)

```
The checksum is an error dection method that verifies the file intgrity. it does this by calculating the sum of all bytes in the file at complication. once its loaded onto the microcontroller, it recalculates the checksum and checks if it matches the already generated one. 

Its used to check if the hex succesfully got uploaded to the microcontroller without any errors
```

## 11)

a)

```
The 8051 has four register banks, each with eight registers
```

b)

```
register A?
```

c)

```
Special Function Registers
```

d)

```
Register Addressing
```

## 12)

a)

```
PUSH
```

b)

```
POP
```

c)

```
The SP (Stack pointer register)
```

## 13)

```assembly

```

## 14)
