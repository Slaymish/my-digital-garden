**Tactics** = Tactics represent the "why" of an attack technique or sub-technique
**Techniques** = Techniques represent 'how' an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action.

## Standardisations

### Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

- Vulnerability = weakness that can be exploited in a cyberattack
- Exposure = mistake that gives an attacker access to system/network
- <https://cve.mitre.org>

### Common Weaknesses Enumeration (CWE)

- A **weakness** is something that *could* be exploited, and become a vulnerability
- 600 class (general case) and base-level (more specific) weaknesses

#### Eg

- `gets()` in C is inherently unsafe

### Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC)

- Tells you how an attack can be done
- <https://capec.mitre.org>
- Can search by mechanism of attack
	- Enage in deceptive intereactions
	- Abuse
