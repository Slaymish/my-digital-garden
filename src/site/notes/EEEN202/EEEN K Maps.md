# Karnaugh Map Method

- 'K Map'
- A graphical method of simplifying logic equations or truth tables
- Similar to Grey Code

## Looping Pairs

- One variable can get eliminated
 
- Can also loop groups of four adj 1's
	- Will elim two variables
	- (can also elim four with 8adj's)

# Grey Code

To convert a truth table into gray code, you can follow these steps:
1. Write the truth table as a binary code.
2. Write the decimal equivalent of the binary code in the left-hand column.
3. Write the binary code in the right-hand column.
4. Starting from the most significant bit, add the current bit to the next bit and write the result in the next row.
5. Repeat step 4 until you reach the least significant bit.
6. The final column is the gray code equivalent of the binary code in the truth table.
