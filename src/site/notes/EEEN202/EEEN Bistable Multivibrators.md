# Bistable Multivibrators

*Electronic circuits with two stable states, used for storing binary data* 

**Latches**
- A type of bistable multivibrator that changes output states based on current input, commonly used in controlling and storing data
**Flip-flops** 
- Similar to latches, but with a clock input to synchronise state changes, providing controlled memory storage and data stability
**Applications** 
- Both latches and flip-flops are essential building blocks for digital systems, such as registers, counters, and more complex memory structures
