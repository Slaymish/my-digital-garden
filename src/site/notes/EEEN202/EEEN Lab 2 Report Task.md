# Lab Report Tasks

1. [x] Results from Section 3: 
	1. [x] 3.1 The Basic SC Latch: Results from experiments (a) to (f) 
	2. [x] 3.2 The Enabled SC Latch: Confirmation that the latch is only sensitive to SC inputs when E = 1 
	3. [x] 3.3 The Transparent D Latch: Observations and results from the digital "sample & hold" application 
	4. [x] 3.4 The Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop: Results from the investigation of the RESET and SET lines, and the timing relation between Q and CLK signal 
	5. [x] 3.5 The JK Edge-Triggered Flip-Flop: The constructed truth table, and waveform sketches for CLK and Q
    
2. [x] Truth tables and/or timing diagrams where needed to illustrate your results.
    
3. [x] Answers to the additional questions in Section 4: 
	1. [x] 4.1 Design of a latching circuit: A description of your design (including a schematic if needed) and its operation 
	2. [x] 4.2 Logic diagram of a D FF using only NOR gates 
	3. [x] 4.3 Sketch of the resultant Q waveform based on the given waveform 
	4. [x] 4.4 Determination of the Q wave in the provided figure
