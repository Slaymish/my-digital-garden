He doesn't want it to be big (not pages and pages)


## 8.1 one-bit half adder

1. Truth table


| A   | B   | SUM | CARRY |
| :-: | :-: |:---:|:-----:|
| 0   | 0   |  0  |   0   |
| 0   | 1   |  1  |   0   |
| 1   | 0   |  1  |   0   |
| 1   | 1   |  0  |   1   |

#### Implementation
1. Using discrete logic gates
We used a two ICs to create it,

2. Using the 74HCT153 MUX


## 8.2 MUX Operations

1. Basic operation of a 4:1 MUX


2. Truth table of a 4:1 MUX


3. How can it be used to implement arbitrary logic function


4. What would the internal structure of a 2:1 MUX look like? (sketch)


5. Discuss operation of the 74HCT153 MUX


6. 74HCT153 MUX truth table


7. Explain the function of the ENABLE inputs


## 8.3 Prime Number detector

1. Truth table (including any simplificaitons)

#### Implementation
1. Using discrete logic gate

2. Using the 74LS153 MUX


3.  Which would result in the min number of ICs used?
