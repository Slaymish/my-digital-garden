# Computer Architectures

## [[Harvard Architecture\|Harvard Architecture]]

- Separates storage and signal pathways for instructions and data
- *no need for the two memories to share characteristics*. 

## Von Neumann Architecture ([[Von Neumann Architecture\|VN]])

- This architecture uses the same physical memory address for instructions and data, requires two clock cycles to execute an instruction, and cannot perform instruction fetches and data transfers at the same time.â€‹

## Complex Instruction Set Computer ([[CISC\|CISC]])

- This architecture includes many specialised instructions, some of which may only be rarely used in practical programs.

## Reduced Instruction Set Computer ([[RISC\|RISC]])

- This architecture simplifies the processor by efficiently implementing only the instructions that are frequently used in programs. The less common operations are implemented as subroutines.
