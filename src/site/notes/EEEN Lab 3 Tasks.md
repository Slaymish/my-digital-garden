# [[EEEN Lab 3 Report\|Report]]

1. [x] Show your circuit designs and results from Section 2
2. [x] Show your results and answer the questions from Section 3
3. 
	1. [x] Sketch a logic diagram to show how a counter can be configured to generate a 1.2 kHz signal from an 18 kHz input signal (assume square wave)
	2. [x] You now have to implement this logic design using one or more 74HCT112 JK FF ICs. Sketch a circuit diagram to show how you will wire up this device to produce this functionality. If needed you may also use further logic gates with the 74HCT112 to produce this circuit.
4. 
	1. [x] Design a frequency divider that will divide the 50 Hz frequency from the mains electricity to generate a 1Hz clock signal. You can assume that the 240 V AC signal has been stepped down by a transformer and the sinusoidal waveform changed into a square wave. Sketch the logic diagram required to produce this frequency divider.
	2. [x] You must now implement this circuit using one or more 74LS293 counter IC's. Sketch a circuit diagram to show how you will wire up this device to produce this functionality. If needed you may also use further logic gates with the 74LS293 to produce this circuit.
5. [x] A Mod 10 counter (which should also be a BCD counter) can be used to drive a seen segment display. This can be achieved by passing the binary coded decimal output from the Mod 10 counter through a BCD-to-seven segment driver decoder such as the HCT4511. Sketch the circuit that shows how you connect your Mod 10 counter through the BCD decoder to drive a seven segment display. You will now be able to directly show the decimal count of your counter output.
