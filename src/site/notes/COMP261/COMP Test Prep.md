[[COMP261/COMP Test01 Info\|Test 1 Info]]

- Nothing on [[COMP261/COMP Regular Expressions\|Regular expressions]]
	- Still be familiar with [[COMP261/COMP Regular Expressions#^00f123\|basic regex grammar]]

- Language defined by the Non-terminal at the start

## Converting to AST
- Keep the things you'd make classes with
- Get rid of stuff that gives no extra info
- Have to give justification for each change **and** thing you keep same


# Study Plan (1hr)
To make the most of the remaining hour before your test, focus on reviewing key concepts and practicing problems related to concrete syntax trees, abstract syntax trees, and parsing code. Here's a study plan for you:

#### Review key concepts (15 minutes):
-   **Understand the difference** between concrete syntax trees (CST) and abstract syntax trees (AST).
-   Know the purpose of a CST (representing the entire source code) and an AST (representing the logical structure of the code).
-   Familiarize yourself with parsing techniques, such as top-down (recursive descent) and bottom-up parsing (shift-reduce).

#### Practice constructing concrete syntax trees (15 minutes):
-   Take a simple programming language construct (e.g., if-else statement, arithmetic expression, or variable assignment).
-   Write down a few examples of code snippets in that language.
-   Construct CSTs for these code snippets by breaking down the grammar and representing each grammar rule as a node in the tree.

#### Practice constructing abstract syntax trees (15 minutes):
-   Use the same code snippets from the previous step.
-   Construct ASTs by simplifying the CSTs and focusing on the essential logical structure of the code.
-   Ensure you can identify the main differences between the CST and AST for each example.

#### Practice writing parsing code (15 minutes):
-   Choose one of the parsing techniques (e.g., recursive descent).
-   Write down a simple grammar for a small language construct (e.g., arithmetic expressions with addition and subtraction).
-   Implement a basic parser function that takes an input string and constructs either a CST or AST based on the grammar rules.
-   Test your parsing code with a few example inputs.

Throughout this process, *stay focused and calm*. Allocate your time effectively and don't spend too long on any single problem. Remember that your understanding of the key concepts and your ability to apply them are the most important aspects to focus on. Good luck!
