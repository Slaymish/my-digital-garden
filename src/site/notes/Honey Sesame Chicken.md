# Honey Sesame Chicken

## **Ingredients:**

- 500g chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 cup corn flour
- 2 eggs, beaten
- Salt and pepper
- Oil for frying

## **For The Sauce:**

- 1/2 cup honey
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup ketchup
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- (Optional) 2 tablespoons corn flour dissolved in 3 tablespoons water

## **For The Rice:**

- 1 cup of rice
- 2 cups of water

## **Instructions:**

1. Start by cooking your rice. Combine the rice and water in a pot and bring it to a boil. 
2. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. This will take about 15-20 minutes.
3. While the rice is cooking, season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper.
4. Dip the seasoned chicken in the beaten eggs, then roll them in the corn flour to fully coat each piece.
5. Heat oil in a large pan or deep fryer to about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
6. Add the chicken pieces in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.
7. Cook the chicken until it's golden brown and crispy. This will take about 3-4 minutes per side.
8. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oil and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
9. While the chicken is frying, make the sauce. Combine the honey, soy sauce, ketchup, sesame oil, and minced garlic in a medium saucepan.
10. Stir the sauce ingredients together and bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat.
11. Once the sauce is simmering, stir in the corn flour-water mixture (if using). Continue to simmer until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency. This will take about 2-3 minutes.
12. When the sauce has thickened, add the fried chicken to the saucepan and stir until the chicken pieces are coated with the sauce.
13. Serve the honey sesame chicken over the cooked rice. Enjoy!

**Note:** The sauce might not thicken as much as it would with cornstarch. If it's not thickening to your liking, try simmering it for a bit longer to reduce it, or add a bit more of the corn flour-water mixture. Be aware that adding too much corn flour could potentially affect the flavor of the sauce.
