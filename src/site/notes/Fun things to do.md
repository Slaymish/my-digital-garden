# Personal Projects

1. **L-System Tree in Java**: Create a program that uses Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems) to generate and visualize tree structures. This can be a great way to explore fractals, recursive algorithms, and computer graphics.

2. **SpeechAssistant Therapist Web-app** - [[ThoughtsAI\|ThoughtsAI]]

3. **General Speech Assistant Web-app**: Create a general-purpose speech assistant web application that can perform tasks such as voice commands, transcription services, and language translation. This could be beneficial for individuals with disabilities or those looking for hands-free solutions to everyday tasks.

4. **Portfolio Website**: Design and develop your personal portfolio website showcasing your skills, projects, and accomplishments. This is an essential tool for networking and job hunting in the tech industry.

5. **Mid-Journey Mag Blender Project**: Pick an interesting concept or design from Mid-Journey Magazine (or any other source of inspiration) and recreate it using Blender, a 3D modeling software. This project will help you learn new techniques and improve your 3D modeling skills.
