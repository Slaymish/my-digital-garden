- Found a way to **commoditise** distributed systems (that we already had)
	- By applying virtual machine technology


Cloud computing is the child of numerous technological attempts at large scale distributed computing:

## Edge Computing

- More nearby than cloud computing
- When you want something quickly

## Interplay of Big Players

- Increasing cloud service providers are building own equipment/operating own networks

### Network Operators

- AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone

### Network Equipment Vendors

- Cisco

### Application and Service Provider

## Basic Setup

- Two nodes and a link
- **Point to point**

### Node

- Computer, phone etc

### Link

- Connection between the nodes
- Cable, fibre optic cable
- Network
