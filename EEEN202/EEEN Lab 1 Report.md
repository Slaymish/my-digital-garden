*Use a short report to show the following results*
[[EEEN202 MOC]]
  

## 8.1

- Show the truth table for your one-bit half adder (Section 3.2.5) 
- Show how you implemented this function by 
	- (i) discrete logic gates (Section 4.4) 
	- 74HCT153 MUX (Section 6.5).  
  

## 8.2

- Describe the basic operation of a multiplexer by describing the operation of a 4:1  MUX. 
- Show the truth table for such a device and 
- explain how the device can be used to implement arbitrary logic functions.  
- (ii) What would the internal structure of a MUX look like ? Sketch the likely internal structure for a 2:1 MUX.  
  
- (iii) Briefly discuss the operation of the 74HCT153 MUX by presenting the truth table.  

- Explain the function of the ENABLE inputs.  
  

## 8.3

- Show your design for a prime number detector by showing the truth table and any simplifications you have made. 
- Now show your logic circuits as based on (i) discrete logic gates and (ii) the 74LS153 MUX. 
- Which one of these two options would be result in the minimum number of ICs to be used ?
