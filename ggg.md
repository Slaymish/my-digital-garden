Sure, here is a list of key points from the article:

- Palantir is launching Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to run large language models like GPT-4 on private networks.
- AIP has been pitched for use in the military, with a demo video showing an operator using a ChatGPT-style chatbot to order drone reconnaissance, generate attack plans, and jam enemy communications.
- The AIP demo video raises concerns about the abstraction and automation of warfare.
- Palantir is not selling a military-specific AI or large language model, but is offering to integrate existing systems into a controlled environment.
- The AIP demo shows the software supporting different open-source LLMs, including FLAN-T5 XL, a fine-tuned version of GPT-NeoX-20B, and Dolly-v2-12b, as well as several custom plug-ins.
- Palantir's pitch emphasizes the need for control over LLMs and algorithms in a sensitive and classified setting, with three pillars of control: deployment into classified networks, user control over LLMs and AIs, and AIP's security features.
- The article raises concerns about the potential dangers of LLMs and AIs in a military context, and notes that AIP does not appear to offer solutions beyond "frameworks" and "guardrails" to mitigate these risks.
