**Abstract**:

```
This paper introduces the Graph of Thought (GoT), an innovative approach to language model processing that extends the concept of the Tree-of-Thought paradigm. The GoT method represents a conversation in a graph-like structure, with the aim of enabling richer contextual understanding and more coherent responses from language models.

**1. Introduction**

```
Recent advancements in language model processing have sought to improve the contextual understanding of machine learning models, leading to the development of the Tree-of-Thought (ToT) approach. This paper extends this concept by introducing the Graph of Thought (GoT), a novel method that envisages conversations in a graph-like manner, thereby broadening the context scope and enhancing response coherence of the model.

**2. Methodology**

```
The GoT methodology builds on the principle of vector similarity, allowing the model to measure each prompt's similarity to others and construct edges between the most alike. A threshold variable can be adjusted to control the number of edges added, offering a flexible approach to graph construction. In addition, the model retains a list of sequential order, potentially factoring the order into edge construction to preserve the natural flow of the conversation.

**3. Graph Analytics Algorithms**

```
The GoT model incorporates various graph analytics algorithms to interpret and navigate the constructed graph. These include measures of centrality such as closeness, degree, betweenness, and Page Rank. These centrality measures can provide insights into the importance of individual nodes (prompts) within the graph, allowing the model to make informed decisions about the most contextually relevant responses.

**4. Pathfinding Algorithms**

```
Pathfinding algorithms such as the A* algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm are employed to traverse the graph and determine the optimal path from the current prompt to a potential response. The heuristic for the A* algorithm could be based on a weight decided by the vector similarity between the user's prompt and potential responses, ensuring that the chosen path is contextually relevant and coherent.

**5. Discussion and Future Work**

```
The Graph of Thought presents an innovative approach to language model processing, extending the capabilities of existing models by implementing a graph-based representation of conversation. By incorporating graph analytics and pathfinding algorithms, the GoT model ensures the contextual relevance and coherence of responses. Future work will focus on refining the graph construction process and exploring how the order of prompts could influence edge construction.

**6. Conclusion**

```
The Graph of Thought marks a significant step forward in the development of language model processing, offering a more nuanced approach to conversation representation and context understanding. This approach holds promise for improving the quality of conversational AI and opening new avenues in natural language processing research.
